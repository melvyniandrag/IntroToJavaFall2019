# Homework 6
By this point you should be aware that Java is a powerful language that can do cool stuff. 

Java can:
1. Do multiple things at one time
2. Read and write files to your computer
3. Detect errors in your program and handle them gracefully without crashing your computer.

And that's pretty neat.

# Problem 1
Write a Java program that spawns two threads. Each thread should write its name to a file (thread1/thread2) and then the program should exit.

# Problem 2
Write a function that throws an exception. Catch the exception in the caller and handle it. Then exit.

# Submission guidelines
Submit your java files on time. Each homework must be unique for credit.
