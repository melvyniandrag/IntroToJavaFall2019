# Homework 2

## Problem 1
This assignment was shamelessly lifted from here:

__Student Time(min)__  
Elena  341  
Thomas 273  
Juan   278  
Maria  329  
Phil   445  
Matt   402  
Alex   388  
Emma   275  
John   243  
James  334  
Jane   412  
Emily  393  
Daniel 299  
Neda   343  
Aaron  317  
Kate   265   

This table contains student names and how long it took them to run 26.2 miles. Write a Java class containing this data that has two methods:

1. getFastestRunner()
2. getSecondFastestRunner()

*getFastestRunner()* returns a string of the form "The fastest runner was Name who ran the race in MINUTES minutes.". And the getSecondFastestRunner() method returns a similar string.

Code to get you started:

```
class Marathon {
  public static void main (String[] arguments) {
    String[] names = {
      "Elena", "Thomas", "Hamilton", "Suzie", "Phil", "Matt", "Alex",
      "Emma", "John", "James", "Jane", "Emily", "Daniel", "Neda",
      "Aaron", "Kate"
    };
    int[] times = {
      341, 273, 278, 329, 445, 402, 388, 275, 243, 334, 412, 393, 299,
      343, 317, 265
    };
    for (int i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
      System.out.println(names[i] + ": " + times[i]);
    }
    
    String fastest = getFastestRunner();
    System.out.println(fastest);
    
    String ifYouAintFirstYoureLast = getSecondFastestRunner();
    System.out.println(ifYouAintFirstYoureLast);
    
  }
}
```

## Problem 2

Shamelessly lifted from here: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-092-introduction-to-programming-in-java-january-iap-2010/assignments/MIT6_092IAP10_assn04.pdf

The assignment has a lot of words ( it isnt TOO hard, but I don't see the sense in retyping it. If the link goes dead, see the Problem2.pdf file in this directory ).
