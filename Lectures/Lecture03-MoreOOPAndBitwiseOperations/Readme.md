# Lecture 3
Another great lecture for you tonight, lots of great information about Java here!

## Annotations

## Interfaces and Inheritance
A crucial concept in programming
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/index.html

[ For the lab have students experiment with Interfaces and inheritance. When are methods overriden? How do you know which
method will be called if you call ChildClass.MethodImplementedInParent() ? How does multiple inheritance work if two parent 
classes define the same method?]

How does Java handle the diamond problem?

## Bitwise operators
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/index.html

A more indepth look at bitwise operators
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op3.html

[For the in class lab, have students parse binary data like I do for work!]

This bitwise stuff is essential CS knowledge that is useful in many languages and for you r understanding of how computers work, that's why its going to be on the midterm.
