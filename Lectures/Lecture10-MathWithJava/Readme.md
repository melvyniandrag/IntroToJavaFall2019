# Some math stuff in Java
Ch.2 from 3D Astornomy with Java.
Maybe demo some of the simulations from the book and discuss it with students.

I love astronomy. I could sit in my yard with the telescope and a few friends every night. There is a great book called 
3D Astronomy With Java which teaches astronomy though the Java language, I really wanted to use it for this class, but I feel like it was too mathematical. I'm experimenting with how to teach this material and make it fun - ultimately the math presented is simple and to do it in Java is really straight forward. Now you all know Java more or less, so we're just going to write code to implement the material in the book in Java to see if you all learn it. 

This lecture is experimental. As I said, the operations are simple. It's a test of how well you can understand a formal requirement and implement it in software. This is good for you because in your career you'll be posed problems which will either intimidate or bore you - but for one reason or another you'll have to do them. I think this is super intersting stuff and I want to see how well you can handle it.
