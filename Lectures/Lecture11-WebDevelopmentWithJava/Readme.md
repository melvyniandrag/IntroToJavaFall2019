# Web Development with Java
Java powers the internet! Java is popular for backend web frameworks. I'm not a specialist web developer, but I've had to do quite a bit of "full stack work" which includes using a thing called a backend framework, so I can teach you a little bit and - if that is going to be your specialty, you can keep studying and then teach me something! I do my web backends in Python because that's what I learned, I don't use it much, and I know python really well, so that's what I use. Now, depending on who you talk to, people will tell you to use the Javascript language on teh backend with somethign like NodeJS, others will say to use Python with Django, others will say to use Ruby on Rails. The list goes on and on. In any event, this is a Java class so we'll take a peek at a Java framework. I wanted to use an "easy one" and based on my extensive research (one strange website):

I see that Play is called an easy framework. If you already know play, you can stay and help the class when we start our lab work, don't worry about being bored, youre going to help me teach.

## Whats a backend framework?
When you type a web address in the browser it talks to a computer somewhere else in the world and fetches some HTML or other things to be shown on YOUR computer. Somehow the server needs to generate this data to be sent to your computer. You can do that using a backend framework!
