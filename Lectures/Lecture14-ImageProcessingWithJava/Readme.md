# Image Processing With Java
## Introduction
In this lecture we continue our tour of cool stuff you can do with Java. This lecture is particularly important because we cover the exact material that will be on your final exam.

We are using all we learned about java and computers in general to do a cool trick. We are going to embed a 4 bit ASCII message in a ppm file and then write some Java to extract it. The code
for this lesson is in the SampleCode directory below here.
