# Sample Final Exam Code
In this bit of code we will roughly do what is required for the final exam. You have a color image in ppm format with some data.

This code contains a few classes in a package that can be used to decode a message that is embedded in the bytes of the image.

ppm format was chosen because other formats have complicated compression and encoding schemes that add complexity - but not value - to our lesson.
