# Making Music With Java
I stink at it, but I like playing my guitar. When I found out that some people were writing music with computers I was blown away. I saw this talk online a few years ago. As a plug, there's a woman who picked up the work of Paul Hudak in doing a similar thing in a language called Haskell, and she's right up the road at Stevens! Anyway this guy andrew sorenson gave this great talk in yet another language, a framework he wrote called Extempore, and in case you haven't seen, just look what people are doing with programming Music!

and it got me eager to get going. Look how he writes code and makes the computer play music. Now you can tell by the code he's writing that it's not Java he did it in. But as I've already told you a million times, Java can do anything! In fact the guy worked on a Java library that works just like his Extempore library! That's what we're going to play with today!

In this lecture we will work through using the jMusic library found here:

We'll talk a bit of music theory and write some music in class. Have students write little things like Mary Had a Little Lamb. Then let's rewrite the Acoustic Trance song from Alec Stansfield!
