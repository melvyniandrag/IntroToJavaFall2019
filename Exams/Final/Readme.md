# Final Exam

## Thoughts
It is hard to give a programming exam.

It can't be too hard, because there is a time constraint. If you have a mental block, 
you would get a zero. So I've decided to tell you in advance what the assignment will be so you can prepare.

Also, it ideally would be on the computer, since Java programming happens on the computer. But I'm telling you in advance what the exam is so you can practice writing the code at home. So, if you have a computer at your fingertips, you could just download and submit the work you already did at home, which defeats the purpose of the exam.

The purpose of the exam, in my mind is to:
1. Test students' knowledge of the subject
2. Force students to master the subject
3. Assign rankings to students in terms of their individual efforts and/or talents, etc. etc..  

## So this is your exam
Write code on paper to convert a color image to grey scale in Java. Your class should read a color image, modify it so it is grey, and save the grey image. 

## Grading
I will take off X points for minor syntax errors given that the code demonstrates understanding and correct intention. No credit for a paper filled with random stuff that looks vaguely like Java.
