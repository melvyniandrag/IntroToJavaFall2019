# Final Exam

## Thoughts
It is hard to give a programming exam.

It can't be too hard, because there is a time constraint. If you have a mental block, 
you would get a zero. So I've decided to tell you in advance what the assignment will be so you can prepare.

Also, it ideally would be on the computer, since Java programming happens on the computer. But I'm telling you in advance what the exam is so you can practice writing the code at home. So, if you have a computer at your fingertips, you could just download and submit the work you already did at home, which defeats the purpose of the exam.

The purpose of the exam, in my mind is to:
1. Test students' knowledge of the subject
2. Force students to master the subject
3. Assign rankings to students in terms of their individual efforts and/or talents, etc. etc..  

I've decided to tell you roughly what will be tested so you can prepare accordingly, and then I'm going to change the problem statement *slightly* and allow you to solve it.

## So this is your exam
Extract a message from an encoded ppm file. I've encoded a message to you in the last 3 bytes of every pixel. You must extractthe last X (3?) bits from every pixel and then add them all together to make an ascii string. What does the string say?

## Grading
100/50/0. 100 for success, 50 in case of some small issue that prevented you from completing the task, 0 for lack of understanding.
